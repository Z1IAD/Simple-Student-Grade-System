Student Grades Project (Qt)
Hello, this is my first project using Qt and C++.
I try to make small app for adding students and their grades.
It show the average and also give letter grade (like A, B, C...).

I made it for learn how to use Qt and make GUI.
Still learning, so maybe code is not best.

What it do:
You can add student with name, ID and subject grades

It count the average and give grade

You can see table with all students

Also you can see report with high and low average

Thanks for see my project 🙏
If you have idea or advice I will be happy!
